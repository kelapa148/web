I graduated from STMIK Professional Makassar with a degree in Information Systems and am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree at [UNIKOM Bandung](https://unikom.ac.id/), focusing on Data Science. I have a strong interest in systems learning, human-computer interaction, and system engineering development. 

I also enjoy visual arts and expressing creativity. In my spare time, I like eating mangoes and snorkeling.
