I am currently studying Information Systems at STMIK Professional Makassar, with a focus on Engineering Systems. I am also studying at Coconut.or.id as a system engineer.

I like systems learning, human-computer interaction, and System engineering development. I also like my fair share of visual arts and creativity. In my spare time, I eat mangoes and play snorkeling.
