Twinkle, twinkle, little star. In the ocean of stars ,there is one little plant that wades in the blue. People name this tiny rolling stone "EARTH".
He joins the lab ocean line in 2021. He pictured the colorful coastal, a shoal of dolphin and comet. Well, there are the dolphins,
the guardian of the stone from the fears plaguing their learning life. In the ocean blue. This floating planet still lives happily along
with jumping dolphins in the blue sky line.
